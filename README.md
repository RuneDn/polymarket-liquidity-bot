<h3> Farm liquidity rewards on Polymarket </h3>


Farm 'liquidity rewards' by placing orders without ever getting them filled. It works by making sure you never have the top order on the orderbook while being close enought to that level with your placed order to be eligible to obtain liquidity rewards. The bot will place and cancel orders on any active market on Ploymarket you select. Every market is handled by another CPU core assuring minimal delay in response time while trading on multiple markets.
